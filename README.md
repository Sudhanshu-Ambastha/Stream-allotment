# Stream Selector

This Python program helps students determine their academic stream based on their subject marks. It follows these criteria:

1. If all subjects have more than 80 marks, it suggests the Science stream.
2. If English has more than 80 marks, and both Math and Science have less than 50 marks, it recommends the Commerce stream.
3. If English has more than 80 marks, and Social Studies (S.St) has more than 80 marks, it indicates the Humanities stream.

## Usage

1. Run the program.

2. Enter the marks for English, S.St, Math, and Science when prompted.

3. The program will determine and display the recommended stream based on the marks.

## Example


Enter marks for English: 85
Enter marks for S.St: 82
Enter marks for Math: 48
Enter marks for Science: 72

Recommended Stream: Humanities
